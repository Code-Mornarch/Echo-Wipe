# Echo-Wipe

## Overview
EchoWipe is a theoretical defensive Python module designed for forensic-grade evidence elimination. Inspired by the "God's Eye" system from *Fast and Furious*, it ensures deniability or provides a clean exit in a general context by securely erasing traces from systems. This project is intended for educational purposes or ethical security research under strictly controlled, authorized conditions.

**Warning**: Unauthorized use of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal under laws like the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.

## Features
- **SSD-Aware Wiping**: Targets solid-state drives with specialized erasure techniques.  
- **Firmware-Level Overwrite**: Overwrites low-level storage firmware to prevent recovery.  
- **AI-Driven Trace Prediction**: Uses machine learning to identify and eliminate residual evidence.  

## Use Cases
- **God’s Eye Context**: Ensures deniability by erasing operational traces.  
- **General Context**: Facilitates a clean exit for research into evidence elimination techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- NVMe-compatible SSD (for wiping; not included)  
- Administrative privileges  

## Dependencies
| Library         | Purpose                     | Installation              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `nvme`          | SSD manipulation            | `pip install nvme`        |
| `tensorflow`    | AI trace prediction         | `pip install tensorflow`  |

Built-in import used: `os`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-Mornarch/Echo-Wipe.git
   cd Echo-Wipe
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure NVMe access:
   - Verify an NVMe SSD is present (e.g., via `lsblk` on Linux or Device Manager on Windows).  
   - Run with admin/root privileges.

## Usage
EchoWipe is a module, not a standalone script. Below is a speculative example of how it might be used (non-functional, as I can’t execute code):

```python
import nvme
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Initialize NVMe controller
controller = nvme.Controller("/dev/nvme0")

# Load AI trace prediction model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("trace_predictor.h5")

def wipe_ssd():
    # Simulate SSD-aware wiping
    controller.format()
    print("SSD formatted")

def overwrite_firmware():
    # Simulate firmware-level overwrite
    random_data = os.urandom(1024)  # Randomized entropy
    controller.firmware_download(random_data)
    controller.firmware_commit()
    print("Firmware overwritten")

def echo_wipe():
    # Predict traces with AI
    system_data = [os.path.getsize(f) for f in os.listdir(".")]
    traces = model.predict([system_data])
    print(f"Predicted traces: {traces}")

    # Wipe SSD and firmware
    wipe_ssd()
    overwrite_firmware()
    
    return "Evidence eliminated"

# Example usage
echo_wipe()
```

- **Steps**:  
  1. Import the module into your project.  
  2. Ensure NVMe SSD access and admin rights.  
  3. Run to simulate forensic-grade wiping.

## Technical Details
- **SSD Wiping**: `nvme` interfaces with NVMe SSDs for secure formatting.  
- **Firmware Overwrite**: Uses `nvme` to overwrite firmware with random entropy from `os.urandom`.  
- **Trace Prediction**: `tensorflow` predicts residual traces (model not included).  

## Limitations
- Requires a pre-trained TensorFlow model (not provided).  
- NVMe-specific; won’t work on SATA or other drives without adaptation.  
- Firmware overwrite is speculative—real use needs vendor-specific commands.  
- Full erasure is never guaranteed against advanced forensics.
